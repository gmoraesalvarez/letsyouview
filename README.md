# letsyouview
Image viewer, supports BPG and WEBP, and will support anything that has a javascript decoder.

To install, copy this repository, put it in ~/.local/share/letsyouview/ and put electron there as well, or call electron from PATH and point to the correct folder. You can install it anywhere, but must change letsyouview bash script to point correctly.

To use just exec letsyouview with the image as argument (full path). letsyouview can sit anywhere. I personally put it in ~/.bin .

The bpg decoder is under its own license, and restrictions may apply for certain uses.
